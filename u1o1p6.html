        <h1>How these tools have helped</h1>
            <p>By properly utilising using Trello, I always know exactly what I have done and what still remains of any project Iâ€™m involved in. I can also provide myself additional notes and labels to note further information. This makes it downright difficult to lose track of my progress.</p>
            <p>Github is a somewhat comparable solution for my HTML code, as it keeps the code constantly updated and helps with version control in case I need to create a more experimental build. As an added bonus, it can be used as a backup in case I misplace the original HTML document or any associated files because Github is an online solution and will retain the last version I uploaded, which I can then download again at any time.</p>
