        <h1>My plans to plan</h1>
            <p>Failure to plan is a plan for failure. That’s why I’ll be using Trello as I’ve mentioned earlier. In fact, there’s a link to my Trello page used to plan this page right here. It’s what I’ve used throughout the course of creating this website and even the text you’re reading right now.</p>
            <p>Trello is an invaluable resource which I’ve used in the past for other projects and I’ve become quite accustomed to. I’m used to using the Kanban methodology which effectively means splitting your ‘cards’ into lists of tasks which are to be done, in progress or complete. You don’t need to know what cards mean to understand the kanban methodology as it isn’t exclusive to Trello; the base principle is simply to organise a project into sub-tasks which are organised into multiple groups according to completion. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">wikipedia</a> article has some more information on this methodology if you’re interested in learning more.</p>
