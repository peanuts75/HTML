        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
            <p>It’s always easy to forget about people who aren’t as able as you are. There are people who are missing limbs, have mental issues, have poor health or have any number of other issues that give them difficulty doing things you take for granted.</p>
            <p>It may not be possible to cater to all needs at all times, but it’s ethically and functionally important to ensure that you maximise your availability to the less able as much as possible. One of the easiest ways to do this is by catering to the colour blind and ensuring that their colour blindness doesn’t preclude them from understanding what they see. There are plenty of resources to help with this, such as the coblis colorsic blindness checker.</p>
            <p>It’s not always possible to cater to every individual’s needs, which is why the term ‘reasonable adjustment’ is useful. If it would be reasonable to make an adjustment to help with accessibility, do it! Otherwise, it might be more costly to your project than beneficial to others; ensure that you weigh the pros and cons of these changes carefully to benefit as many users as possible.</p>
