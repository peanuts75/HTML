        <h1>Copyright constraints</h1>
            <p>Developing a website can take a considerable amount of assets, usually images which can help to enhance the aesthetic. It’s easy to forget that someone took the time to make that image, and it might even belong to an organisation that would be... irked, were you to ‘borrow’ it. Tread lightly when you’re using work that others have created, and only use content that you’re sure is free from any kind of copyright constraints.</p>
            <p>Images aren’t the only potential issue for copyright laws, as there are plenty of other elements involved such as libraries for Javascript. Ideally, the licence for the assets you incorporate should be either non-copyrighted or your own work. Frankly, it wouldn’t be worth upsetting someone by stealing their work even if it were legal. Ideally, create all the content yourself rather than using anyone elses without direct permission.</p>
            <p>If you’re in any doubt about how copyright laws work, it’s worth reading an official resource.</p>
