        <h1>Appropriate file types for websites</h1>
            <p>Websites are capable of storing data in practically any form, but storing usable data is a different matter and there may be a better way to do it than it first appears. Web pages use the HTML file type and are usually accompanied by a CSS file. Different libraries can increase the number of filetypes that you can effectively use, but by default it’s a good idea to use .png and .gif for images and .mp4 or .avi for videos.</p>
            <p>Since technology is so rapidly changing, it’s important to pay attention to what’s most commonly used and most supported. For example, Adobe Flash was once extremely popular across the web but it is now no longer being developed and browsers are halting their support for it, so developing and implementing flash content will almost guarantee imminent redundancy.</p>
