        <h1>What you should use</h1>
            <p>There are more applications that you can use than you could possibly count, and that’s a fact. Software developers are constantly creating new solutions to new problems and it can be pretty difficult to know what to use. As far as I’m concerned, there are a few different key aspects that can help to identify what kind of applications are appropriate.<br>
            <ul><li>Familiarity: How much experience you have with the software</li><br>
                <li>Skill: How skilled you are with the software</li><br>
                <li>Community: A helpful support group can make getting solving issues much easier</li><br>
                <li>Power: How effective it can be for the end goal</li><br>
                <li>Speed: How quickly the software can be used to achieve the end goal</li><br>
                <li>Bonuses: Unnecessary but helpful or pleasant functionality, like copy-paste integration</li><br>
                <li>Cost: The price of the main product and any subscriptions or licences required</li><br>
                <li>Reputation: If there are other people who use and recommend the software, it may work well</li><br>
                <li>Security: Whether or not software can be trusted throughout the project</li></ul><br>
            <p>Some of these may not always be applicable, and there are often other factors that are, but generally it’s useful to acknowledge these 9 aspects when deciding what software to use in any situation.</p>
            <p>Any user will need to practice using their tools, just as they would any other piece of technology. It’s important to develop general computer skills, an understanding of software as a whole and a more specific skill set to suit each of the individual applications you’ll be using. If you’re not skilled in whatever you’re planning to use, you can still learn though. The internet is a valuable resource for this, and if you’re not skilled enough to find it online then you can still find a library or even an introductory course on a variety of computer-related activities.</p>
            <p>The only true limit to how much you can learn and use is time, the most valuable resource that there is. As long as you can practice with software, you can probably master it. This accounts for a large amount of what I’ve learned about computers actually, as I’ve been toying around with them since I was a kid. All it takes is time, patience and persistence.</p>
