                <h1>The technological world we now live in</h1>
                    <br>
                    </p>Technology has always been somewhat of a focal point for human culture, as we have always been creating new technologies and utilising it to the benefit of mankind. We used to consider an especially sharp rock to be a tool, then we learned to smelt, then to create computers, then how to make rockets that reach the moon. We’ve literally been shooting for the stars, and whether you hate it or love it we’re now firmly in the digital age.<br>
                    <br>
                    The downside to having such sophisticated technology is that if we choose not to use it, we’re often quickly overtaken by others that do use it. In the business world, it would be completely unrealistic to run a company using stone-age technology, but using an experienced team with heavy software experience that same team can do things that no other age could comprehend.<br>
                    <br>
                    A company with digital technology can contact one another practically instantly from opposite sides of the globe, transferring extraordinarily large amounts of data to one another, even collaborating on the same project without having met one another in the flesh. Considering that this kind of technology is fast becoming the standard, it’s necessary to embrace it or falling behind is guaranteed. Even with a business consisting of one person, today’s technology can radically improve that person’s self-management, social accessibility and countless other aspects of their trade.</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>What you should use</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are more applications that you can use than you could possibly count, and that’s a fact. Software developers are constantly creating new solutions to new problems and it can be pretty difficult to know what to use. As far as I’m concerned, there are a few different key aspects that can help to identify what kind of applications are appropriate.<br>
                    <br>
                    <ul><li>Familiarity: How much experience you have with the software</li><br>
                    <li>Skill: How skilled you are with the software</li><br>
                    <li>Community: A helpful support group can make getting solving issues much easier</li><br>
                    <li>Power: How effective it can be for the end goal</li><br>
                    <li>Speed: How quickly the software can be used to achieve the end goal</li><br>
                    <li>Bonuses: Unnecessary but helpful or pleasant functionality, like copy-paste integration</li><br>
                    <li>Cost: The price of the main product and any subscriptions or licences required</li><br>
                    <li>Reputation: If there are other people who use and recommend the software, it may work well</li><br>
                    <li>Security: Whether or not software can be trusted throughout the project</li></ul><br>
                    <br>
                    Some of these may not always be applicable, and there are often other factors that are, but generally it’s useful to acknowledge these 9 aspects when deciding what software to use in any situation.
                    Any user will need to practice using their tools, just as they would any other piece of technology. It’s important to develop general computer skills, an understanding of software as a whole and a more specific skill set to suit each of the individual applications you’ll be using. If you’re not skilled in whatever you’re planning to use, you can still learn though. The internet is a valuable resource for this, and if you’re not skilled enough to find it online then you can still find a library or even an introductory course on a variety of computer-related activities.<br>
                    <br>
                    The only true limit to how much you can learn and use is time, the most valuable resource that there is. As long as you can practice with software, you can probably master it. This accounts for a large amount of what I’ve learned about computers actually, as I’ve been toying around with them since I was a kid. All it takes is time, patience and persistence.</p><br>

                    <br>
                <h1>My plans to plan</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Failure to plan is a plan for failure. That’s why I’ll be using Trello as I’ve mentioned earlier. In fact, there’s a link to my Trello page used to plan this page right <a href="https://trello.com/b/JV4z8bOr/webdesign">here</a>. It’s what I’ve used throughout the course of creating this website and even the text you’re reading right now.<br>
                    <br>
                    Trello is an invaluable resource which I’ve used in the past for other projects and I’ve become quite accustomed to. I’m used to using the Kanban methodology which effectively means splitting your ‘cards’ into lists of tasks which are to be done, in progress or complete. You don’t need to know what cards mean to understand the kanban methodology as it isn’t exclusive to Trello; the base principle is simply to organise a project into sub-tasks which are organised into multiple groups according to completion. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">wikipedia</a> article has some more information on this methodology if you’re interested in learning more.</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>Risks of digital projects</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Technology isn’t magic. That’s effectively a lot of why digital project’s fail; people often expect computers to do the impossible and don’t understand what is truly required or how to get the required result. If you’re going to use a computer, you need to understand that it requires input to create output, and that input is something you’ll always need to account for.<br>
                    <br>
                    To make a digital project, you’ll have to plan it out and ensure that you have the resources, skills, knowledge and technology to execute it. Of course, this can be done before or during the project, but it’s much more efficient to do so before the project so that you can devote more time and resources towards this. <br>
                    <br>
                    Project management is also, of course, of paramount importance. This can involve making sure that any teammates are assigned to tasks in order to divide the workload, setting deadlines to certain parts of the project, adding reminders of tasks to be done or ensuring that tasks are not completed multiple times unnecessarily among other possibilities. Good project management can be the difference between missing several deadlines with an underdeveloped project and completing the project well ahead of schedule with a well polished project.</p><br>

                    <br>
                <h1>What I use</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>A couple of applications that I know I’ll be using for any web development projects, thanks to a good combination of these values, are Trello, Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome.<br>
                    <br>
                    Trello is an online project management app which is available for free, easy to use, feature rich, and I’ve had prior experience using it to complete projects. It’s always essential to use a project management tool of some sort as the difference in organisation can be monumental, even when there’s only one person involved in the project. If nothing else, it’s a useful place to place reminders and see what you need to do next.<br>
                    <br>
                    Visual Studio Code is the main program that I’m using to create the end result, as it is a software development program which is suitable for HTML, the language which web pages use. Generally, there will be a main tool for whatever project you’re involved in, even if that tool is your project management tool.<br>
                    <br>
                    Google Chrome is the web browser that I’ll be using to test this website, and it’s always important to test any software that you develop as it’s otherwise impossible to know what kind of issues the end user will receive. In fact, it’s often important to test what you’re creating regularly even if you’re not developing software as humans and machines do not read and write in the same language and you might disagree with one another, creating issues that you wouldn’t notice without testing.<br>
                    <br>
                    When working with software development, a widely accepted standard is called Git, Git and Github are used for version control, to identify, branch and update your software as it’s in development. A branch, in git, is a separate course of development for the software which means that one course of development can involve certain changes whilst the other branch is completely unaffected. This is particularly helpful with experimental builds, as it means that those who need a stable build of the program have access to it, as do those who don’t need the stability and instead want to see the bleeding edge of the app’s development.</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>How these tools have helped</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>By properly utilising using Trello, I always know exactly what I have done and what still remains of any project I’m involved in. I can also provide myself additional notes and labels to note further information. This makes it downright difficult to lose track of my progress.<br>
                    <br>
                    Github is a somewhat comparable solution for my HTML code, as it keeps the code constantly updated and helps with version control in case I need to create a more experimental build. As an added bonus, it can be used as a backup in case I misplace the original HTML document or any associated files because Github is an online solution and will retain the last version I uploaded, which I can then download again at any time.</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>Legal issues</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>One important aspect to mention when creating any kind of digital project is the legality involved. Even when you think what you’ve created is all your own work, remember that it was made using a program that someone created, on an operating system that someone created, on hardware that someone created. Generally speaking, the hardware isn’t relevant, but any software that you’ve used is a potential risk for legal issues if you don’t acquire the relevant licences. This can be avoided by using software that doesn’t require licensing, but the term ‘you get what you pay for’ may be in effect if all the software you use is totally free.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also, ‘Free’ can mean ‘free to use without distribution’, ‘free to distribute with certain attachments’ or ‘free to modify and distribute’ among others. There are a variety of different licences with different restrictions on what you can do with that software, and if you invalidate the licence then you’re using it illegally. You must always ensure that the licences you have are suitable for what you want to do with them.<br>
                    <br>
                    As the world adapts to modern technology, the law and regulations are still catching up and new rules or guidelines are being still being released. It’s important to keep track of what is and isn’t illegal, such as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act</a> and the General Data Protection Regulation which vary upon where the data is located. An example that is present in both of these examples is that data associated with individuals must be stored and used only when necessary, a precaution which can help to minimise data theft such as credit card information.</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>Copyright constraints</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Developing a website can take a considerable amount of assets, usually images which can help to enhance the aesthetic. It’s easy to forget that someone took the time to make that image, and it might even belong to an organisation that would be... irked, were you to ‘borrow’ it. Tread lightly when you’re using work that others have created, and only use content that you’re sure is free from any kind of copyright constraints.<br>
                    <br>
                    Images aren’t the only potential issue for copyright laws, as there are plenty of other elements involved such as libraries for Javascript. Ideally, the licence for the assets you incorporate should be either non-copyrighted or your own work. Frankly, it wouldn’t be worth upsetting someone by stealing their work even if it were legal. Ideally, create all the content yourself rather than using anyone else's without direct permission.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you’re in any doubt about how copyright laws work, it’s worth reading an <a href="https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p01_uk_copyright_law">official resource</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>Accessibility</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>It’s always easy to forget about people who aren’t as able as you are. There are people who are missing limbs, have mental issues, have poor health or have any number of other issues that give them difficulty doing things you take for granted.<br>
                    <br>
                    It may not be possible to cater to all needs at all times, but it’s ethically and functionally important to ensure that you maximise your availability to the less able as much as possible. One of the easiest ways to do this is by catering to the colour blind and ensuring that their colour blindness doesn’t preclude them from understanding what they see. There are plenty of resources to help with this, such as the <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">coblis colorise blindness checker</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    It’s not always possible to cater to every individual’s needs, which is why the term ‘reasonable adjustment’ is useful. If it would be reasonable to make an adjustment to help with accessibility, do it! Otherwise, it might be more costly to your project than beneficial to others; ensure that you weigh the pros and cons of these changes carefully to benefit as many users as possible.</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h1>Appropriate file types for websites</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Websites are capable of storing data in practically any form, but storing usable data is a different matter and there may be a better way to do it than it first appears. Web pages use the HTML file type and are usually accompanied by a CSS file. Different libraries can increase the number of filetypes that you can effectively use, but by default it’s a good idea to use .png and .gif for images and .mp4 or .avi for videos.<br>
                    <br>
                    Since technology is so rapidly changing, it’s important to pay attention to what’s most commonly used and most supported. For example, Adobe Flash was once extremely popular across the web but it is now no longer being developed and browsers are halting their support for it, so developing and implementing flash content will almost guarantee imminent redundancy.</p><br>
