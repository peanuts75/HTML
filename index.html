            <p>My name is Robert Spottiswood.<br>
            I’m a programmer-in-training and an aspiring game developer.</p>
            <p>I’ve been fiddling around with code of various different programming languages and when I heard about a class for beginner developing I jumped at the chance to have a more active experience with computers.</p>
            <p>I’ve tried making things in plenty of different programming languages, different software environments, different game engines, even across different operating systems.</p>
            <p>Of course, when I’m not experimenting with technology, I’m probably playing games. I mean, who doesn’t like playing games? It’s because of all of the fantastic games out there that I’ve been so inspired to create something, anything, that’ll make a mark on the technological world and make a positive contribution to the technological world we now live in.</p>
